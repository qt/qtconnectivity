\title Qt NFC
\brief Qt NFC enables connectivity between NFC enabled devices.

NFC is an extremely short-range (less than 20 centimeters) wireless technology and has a
maximum transfer rate of 424 kbit/s.  NFC is ideal for transferring small packets of data when two
devices are touched together.

The NFC API provides APIs for interacting with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including
target detection and loss, registering NDEF message handlers, reading and writing NDEF messages
on NFC Forum Tags, sending tag specific commands, client and server LLCP sockets for bidirectional
communication between two NFC Forum Devices.

\section1 Getting started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:
