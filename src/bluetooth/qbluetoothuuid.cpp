    \enum QBluetoothUuid::ServiceClassUuid

    This enum is a convienience type for Bluetooth service class and profile UUIDs. Values of this type will be
    implicitly converted into a QBluetoothUuid when necessary. Some UUIDs refer to service class ids, others to profile
    ids and some can be used as both. In general, profile UUIDs shall only be used in a
    \l QBluetoothServiceInfo::BluetoothProfileDescriptorList attribute and service class UUIDs shall only be used
    in a \l QBluetoothServiceInfo::ServiceClassIds attribute. If the UUID is marked as profile and service class UUID
    it can be used as a value for either of the above service attributes. Such a dual use has historical reasons
    but is no longer permissible for newer UUIDs.

    The list below explicitly states as what type each UUID shall be used. Bluetooth Low Energy related values
    starting with 0x18 were introduced by Qt 5.4
