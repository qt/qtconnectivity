    \class QBluetoothLocalDevice
    \inmodule QtBluetooth
    \brief The QBluetoothLocalDevice class enables access to the local Bluetooth
    device.

    QBluetoothLocalDevice provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth
    devices.
*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Pairing

    This enum describes the pairing state between the two Bluetooth devices.

    \value Unpaired         The Bluetooth devices are not paired.
    \value Paired           The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will prompt the user for
                            authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
    \value AuthorizedPaired The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will not prompt the user
                            for authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
*/

/*!
  \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Error

  This enum describes errors that maybe returned

  \value NoError        No known error
  \value PairingError   Error in pairing
  \value UnknownError   Unknown error

*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::HostMode

    This enum describes the most of the local Bluetooth device.

    \value HostPoweredOff       Power off the device
    \value HostConnectable      Remote Bluetooth devices can connect to the local Bluetooth device
    if they have previously been paired with it or otherwise know its address. This powers up the
    device if it was powered off.
    \value HostDiscoverable     Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
    Bluetooth device. The device will also be connectable, and powered on.
    \value HostDiscoverableLimitedInquiry Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
     Bluetooth device when performing a limited inquiry. This should be used for locating services that are
     only made discoverable for a limited period of time. This can speed up discovery between gaming devices,
     as service discovery can be skipped on devices not in LimitedInquiry mode. In this mode, the device will
     be connectable and powered on, if required.

    the system can ask the user for confirmation before turning Bluetooth on or off. Not all host modes may be

  The \a state of the host has transitioned to a different HostMode.

  must be called to indicate if the user accepts or rejects the displayed pin.

  To be called after getting a pairingDisplayConfirmation().  The \a accept parameter either
  accepts the pairing or rejects it.

  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingDisplayPinCode(const QBluetoothAddress &address, QString pin)

  Signal by some platforms to display the \a pin to the user for \a address.  The pin is automatically

*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::requestPairing(const QBluetoothAddress &address, Pairing pairing)

  Set the \a pairing status with \a address.  The results are returned by the signal, pairingFinished().

  Pairing has completed with \a address. Current pairing status is in \a pairing.
