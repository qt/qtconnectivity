    \class QBluetoothLocalDevice
    \brief The QBluetoothLocalDevice class provides access to local Bluetooth devices.

    \ingroup connectivity-bluetooth
    \inmodule QtConnectivity
    \since 5.0

    QBluetoothLocalDevice provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth
    devices.
*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Pairing

    This enum describes the pairing state between two Bluetooth devices.

    \value Unpaired         The Bluetooth devices are not paired.
    \value Paired           The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will prompt the user for
                            authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
    \value AuthorizedPaired The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will not prompt the user
                            for authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
*/

/*!
  \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Error

  This enum describes errors that maybe returned

  \value NoError        No known error
  \value PairingError   Error in pairing
  \value UnknownError   Unknown error

*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::HostMode

    This enum describes the most of the local Bluetooth device.

    \value HostPoweredOff       Powers the device down
    \value HostConnectable      Remote Bluetooth devices can connect to the local Bluetooth device
                                if they have previously been paired with it or otherwise know its
                                address. This powers up the device if it was powered off.
    \value HostDiscoverable     Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
                                Bluetooth device.  The device will also be connectable, and powered on.
    \value HostDiscoverableLimitedInquiry Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
                                Bluetooth device when performing a limited inquiry.  This should be used for
                                locating services that are only made discoverable for a limited period of time.
                                This can speed up discovery between games for example, since service
                                discovery can be skipped on devices not in limited enquiry more.  This
                                is not supported on all platforms. The device will also be connectable, and powered on.
