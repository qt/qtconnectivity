    \class QBluetoothTransferReply
    \inmodule QtBluetooth
    \brief The QBluetoothTransferReply class stores the response for a data
    transfer request.

    In additional to a copy of the QBluetoothTransferRequest object used to create the request,
    QBluetoothTransferReply contains the contents of the reply itself.

    QBluetoothTransferReply is a sequential-access QIODevice, which means that once data is read
    from the object, it is no longer kept by the device. It is the application's
    responsibility to keep this data if it needs to. Whenever more data is received and processed,
    the readyRead() signal is emitted.

    The downloadProgress() signal is also emitted when data is received, but the number of bytes
    contained in it may not represent the actual bytes received, if any transformation is done to
    the contents (for example, decompressing and removing the protocol overhead).

    Even though QBluetoothTransferReply is a QIODevice connected to the contents of the reply, it
    emits the uploadProgress() signal, which indicates the progress of the upload for
    operations that have such content.
