\qmlmodule QtBluetooth 5.0
\title Qt Bluetooth QML API
\brief A QML API enabling basic Bluetooth operations like scanning for devices
and connecting them.

The Qt Bluetooth QML API enables an application to scan for devices and connect and
interact with them in an easier way than the C++ Classes. However, it is a bit
more limited than the C++ API. You can always use the C++ API to create QML
plugins with the flexibility you need.

To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
import statement in your \c .qml file:

\snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml import
