\title Bluetooth QML API
\brief A QML API enabling basic Bluetooth operations like scanning for Devices
and connecting them.

\ingroup qtconnectivity
\ingroup qtconnectivity-qml

The Bluetooth API enables an application to scan for devices and connect and
interact with them in an easier way than the C++ Classes. However, it is a bit
more limited than the C++ API. You can always use the C++ API to create QML
plugins with the flexibility you need.

\section1 Getting Started

To import the Bluetooth Elements, use the following:

\snippet ../doc/src/snippets/doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml import

After importing the Bluetooth API you can use its elements. For example:

\snippet ../doc/src/snippets/doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml service

To make your application link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
.pro file:

\snippet ../doc/src/snippets/doc_src_qtbluetooth.pro contacts project modification
