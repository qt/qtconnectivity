\title Qt Bluetooth QML API
\brief A QML API enabling basic Bluetooth operations like scanning for devices
and connecting them.

\ingroup qtconnectivity
\ingroup qtconnectivity-qml

The Qt Bluetooth QML API enables an application to scan for devices and connect and
interact with them in an easier way than the C++ Classes. However, it is a bit
more limited than the C++ API. You can always use the C++ API to create QML
plugins with the flexibility you need.
