    \title Qt Bluetooth
    \brief Qt Bluetooth enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.

    Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless technology. It
    has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal
    for transfering data between devices.

    Bluetooth connectivity is based on basic device management, such as scanning
    for devices, gathering information about them, and exchaning data between
    them.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
    option to your \c .pro file:

    \snippet ../doc/src/snippets/doc_src_qtbluetooth.pro contacts project modification

    To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
    import statement in your \c .qml file:

    \snippet ../doc/src/snippets/doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml import
