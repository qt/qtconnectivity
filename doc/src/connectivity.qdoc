\title Qt5 Local Connectivity Reference Documentation
\page connectivity.html
\brief The Local Connectivity APIs facilitates communication with local devices.

\tableofcontents

\section1 Overview

The Qt local connectivity addon APIs provides a set of APIs for communicating with local devices.

The current version of the local connectivity APIs includes support for Bluetooth and Near Field
Communication (NFC) technologies. Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless
technology. It has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal for
transfering data between devices.

The Bluetooth API provides classes for controlling the local Bluetooth device, discovering devices
in the local vacinity, discovering services provided by those devices, publishing services and both
server and client sockets for L2CAP and RFCOMM protocols.

NFC is an extremely short-range (approx. 1 centimeter) wireless techonology and has a maximum
transfer rate of 424 kbit/s. NFC is ideal for transfer small packets of data when two devices are
touched together.

The NFC API provides APIs for interacting with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including
target detection and loss, registering NDEF message handlers, reading and writing NDEF messages to
NFC Forum Tags, send tag specific commands. The API also provides client and server LLCP sockets.

\section1 Known Issues and Limitations

\section2 NFC

The NFC API is only supported on Maemo6 and Symbian^3 and the Qt Simulator. On Symbian^3 the API is
fully functional. On the Qt Simulator only target detection and loss and tag access are support. On
Maemo6 the following features are \bold NOT supported:

\list
    \o Connectionless LLCP sockets (both client and server).
    \o Tag type specific access.
\endlist
